             What was it like growing up in Senotlelo and how was your family life?

            </p>
            <p>
              I think growing up in Senotlelo had it's own challenges, some were normal to most families and I didn't even note them as challenges because they were common to most families. 
But it was generally not bad, I grew up in a stable family setup, with both parents, they did their best with me.

            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">
              Which year did you start your high school? How would you describe yourself in high school?

             
            </p>

            <p>I started my high school in 1984 at Mokebe Secondary, from 1984 to1988 when I  matriculated.
              I was one of the good performers in my class and
              I was a dedicated person when it came to my school work. 
              </p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">
                Being learner at Mokebe Secondary and living in Senotlelo village then, how did you envision your future?
              </p>

              <p>
                I always had this vision of using education to be better in the future despite not
                 having lot of people in the area to look up to in terms of what I aspired to do, 
                 but I had convinced myself to do something different and that was Engineering studies.

              </p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">What influenced your career aspirations? What motivated you to pursue it?
              </p>

              <p>
                We did not have much on career guidance, I took a lot of readings into careers and developed a liking for Engineering and Law Studies.

But I decided to persue Engineering as I had more liking to it.

              <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">
                Where did you pursue your career and how long did it take you to complete your studies?
              </p>

              <p>I started my post matric studies at Technikon Northern Transvaal in 1989, completed in 1991. I then did in-service training with Sasol to complete the diploma.  It became a challenge to secure the training immediately after I completed my course. In 1994 to 1995, 3 years later  I did my In-service and graduated. So it took a while to complete my diploma.
 
              </p>

              <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">What challenges you met pursuing your career?Especially as a former leaner of Mokebe Secondary
                 and a child from Senotlelo Village? How did you navigate through the challenges?</p>

                 <p>

                  I think for me the challenge was between 1992 to beginning 1994, while searching for in service training. It was just challenging to apply while staying in Senotlelo, to start with, the Post Office was not functioning well and there was no telephones. Companies trying to get hold of me was a challenge and I missed some Interview appointments because of that.
There were only  2 or 3 shops with telephones at that time.
 

                 </p>

                 <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">What other qualifications did you study to advance your career?</p>

                 <p>I studied Electrical Engineering (Heavy Current) and ventured to a specialised career in Electrical Protection. I undergone heavy training for Electrical Protection. Later on the career I was selected to do Management Diploma through Unisa, it was an unintended path that was chosen for me, as I moved into Technical Management Position. I also did post
                   graduate Management qualification to support the managerial position.</p>
                   <p>I started working in April 1994 at Sasol in Sasolburg as an Operations Trainee then completed my training in September 1995.
                  </p>
                  <p>I was then appointed as a Technician in October 1995 and worked for Sasol till September 1997.</p>
                      <p>In October 1997 to 2005,  I started at Eskom as  a Senior Technician and later as a Section Engineer.
                      </p>
                      <p>In October 2005 I was appointed into Technical Management 
                        position and I moved in different management sections till to date.</p>

                        <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">What fulfils you most about your career? And how did it shape you as an individual?</p>
                        <p>My career is specialist function that requires availability at all times, so it is very challenging. The technologies used develops fast and there is never a dull moment. It is a fulfilling career when you love it. So essentially it teaches you to value time and moments.
                          Managing teams of individuals gave me an opportunity to learn human interaction skills with different people on daily basis. So it built me as individual and I’ve learned to work as an individual and in a team.

                          </p>

                          <p>I think you need to have a passion for the career first because it is challenging. It requires one to be at work at all times, but it is rewarding career to follow as well.
                          </p>

                          <p style="font-weight: bold; color:rgb(143, 0, 0); padding:25px 0px; font-size:larger">A motto or quote you live by?</p>
            
                          <p>Luck favours the best prepared, and when you get an opportunity give it your best.
