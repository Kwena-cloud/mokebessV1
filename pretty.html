            <h4>A story of Dr Pretty Makube</h4><br><br>
            <p>
              “The day I decided to study medicine and took a look at the university admission requirements
              against my grade 11 results, I knew I had to unleash another level of my academic potential”
              says Dr. Pretty Makube with a qualification, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery
              Degree. Makube graduated from Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University, previously know as
              Medical University of South Africa(MEDUNSA). She completed the course in 6 years record time.

              Makube stumbled upon the medical course in her grade 11 Life Orientation text book where she
              began to take and built interest on the career. She began to further her interests by pursuing a
              research on how she can become a medical doctor. Through the research she found out that, her
              biggest drive wasn’t helping and healing people but the security that came with being medical
              doctor.

              Coming from humble beginnings, Makube was left in the care of her grandmother after her mother
              passed at just 9 years old. She recalls her grandmother as very strict but yet supportive, she
              wanted what was best for her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fortunately for Makube had always wanted more for herself too, she drawn inspiration from
              previous products of Mokebe Secondary who were doing exceptionally well for themselves, her
              inspiration focused on people related to her then background.

              While her inspiration, hard work and drive landed her in medical school, her biggest challenge
              was her lack of eloquence in English. Although she passed the English subject in flying colours
              she still struggled to express herself well in the language compared to her peers from Model Cs
              Schools

              “English in Senotlelo is taught in Sepedi,” she says jokingly. It took her a while to adjust to
              her new medium of communication and learning and she emphasizes that surrounding yourself with
              people that understand your situation and shortfalls helped her a lot.
            </p>
            <p>
              She advises that being a doctor is doable but it comes with sacrifices, she had to cut down on
              leisure time. She says that six years is a very long time and your classmates from high school
              will graduate and settle into their careers before you do. She adds that you might begin to feel
              that your degree is taking a long time.
              She mentions that her transition into the workplace was mentally daunting especially after
              completing a six year degree. “Before I scare you, Medicine is a rewarding career and if you
              want to join us, go for it,” she says.

              Her biggest reward is gratitude from her patients. She mentions that patients are very observant
              about how you treat them as human beings rather than helping them medically. She says a mere
              thank goes a long way for her and hearing the words “Thank You Doctor” warms up her heart

              She quotes Mr Maredi, her former English and Sepedi teacher from Mokebe Secondary, “ There is
              life beyond the horizons of Senotlelo,” she concludes.
